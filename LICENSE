The **MIT License** is the legal bedrock of the anthology—keeping the gates open for the community while ensuring you, the Architect, are protected from liability.

### A Note from the Anthology

Hanz might add a final bit of flavor to this legal pact:

> "This license is a gesture of trust. Take these rings, use them to build your own worlds, and share the stories you find there. All we ask is that you keep the Architect’s name on the blueprint."
