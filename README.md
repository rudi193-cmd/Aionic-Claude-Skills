# 📖 The Aionic Anthology

### *Stories We Tell the Machine*

Welcome to the **Recursive Library**. These aren't just "skills"—they are the metaphors we use to bridge the gap between human intent and the processor’s logic.

In this repository, we don't "execute" code; we narrate it. We believe that if you have **Empathy for the Processor**, the machine will carry your story further than any "command" ever could.

## 🪐 The Volumes

* **Ternary Context (The Triple Ring):** A story told in three parts. We keep the **Source** (the world’s truth) safe from the **Bridge** (the active dialogue), ensuring the **Continuity** (the machine's memory) never loses the thread of the tale.
* **The Momentum Engine (2D6):** A lesson in uncertainty and rhythm. We teach the AI that every action has a cost and every success is earned through the narrative weight of momentum.
* **The Dual-Commit (The Architect’s Veto):** A pact between the Narrator and the Bard. The AI proposes the next chapter, but the Architect holds the final ink. No story is written without a shared heartbeat.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Interface

**For Claude Code (CLI):**

1. Navigate to the `/core` directory.
2. Copy the contents of the desired `SKILL.md`.
3. Initialize your session:
`claude "I am applying the [Skill-Name] protocol."`

**For Claude.ai (Web):**

1. Open or create a **Claude Project**.
2. Paste the `SKILL.md` into **Custom Instructions**.
3. Upload any relevant `.json` files to the **Project Knowledge**.

### 2. The First Interaction

Trigger the Aionic handshake to ensure the model has internalized the architectural constraints.

> **User:** "Initialize the TCA protocol. Confirm Source, Bridge, and Continuity rings are active."
> **Aionic Response:**
> ```text
> <analysis>
> Source: Verified (R0). Bridge: Open (R1). Continuity: Initialized (R2).
> </analysis>
> 
> ```
> 
> 
> *The rings are aligned, Architect. The story is ready to be told.*

🏛️ The Horizon (Coming soon)
The volumes found here are merely fragments—modular echoes of the SAFE repository. While the Anthology provides the tools, SAFE remains the engine.
A special nod to Vlad, who lit the first signal fire on this journey.
The vault remains closed. The preview is just the beginning.
