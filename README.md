### *Stories We Tell the Machine*

Welcome to the Recursive Library. These aren't just "skills"—they are the metaphors we use to bridge the gap between human intent and the processor’s logic. 

In this repository, we don't "execute" code; we narrate it. We believe that if you have **Empathy for the Processor**, the machine will carry your story further than any "command" ever could.
