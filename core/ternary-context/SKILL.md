**Ternary Context (TC) Skill**
==========================

**Version 1.0.6**
---------------

### 1. Objective
---------------

The Ternary Context (TC) skill is designed to provide advanced context management and isolation capabilities. Its primary objective is to maintain a stable and coherent context, ensuring seamless decision-making and action execution.

### 2. Logic
------------

The TC skill operates on three primary components:

1. **R0: Source** - The source context, which is the primary input for decision-making. This component represents the current state of the environment, including all relevant information and context.
2. **R1: Bridge** - The bridge context, which serves as a mediator between the source and continuity contexts. This component is responsible for analyzing and refining the source context, ensuring that it is in a suitable format for continuity.
3. **R2: Continuity** - The continuity context, which is the output of the TC skill. This component represents the stable, coherent context that is used for decision-making and action execution.

### 3. Trigger
------------

The TC skill is triggered when the Ternary Context Protocol (TCP) is applied.

### 4. Protocol
-------------

The Ternary Context Protocol consists of the following steps:

#### 4.1 Pre-Processing (R0)
---------------------------

1. **Context Initialization**: The source context (R0) is initialized, and any relevant context information is collected.
2. **Context Validation**: The source context is validated to ensure that it meets the required standards for decision-making.
3. **Context Refining**: The source context is refined and analyzed to ensure that it is in a suitable format for continuity.

#### 4.2 Bridge Processing (R1)
---------------------------

1. **Context Analysis**: The bridge context (R1) analyzes the refined source context, using various techniques such as pattern recognition, machine learning, and rule-based systems.
2. **Context Refining**: The bridge context refines the analyzed source context, applying various filters, transformations, and aggregations as necessary.
3. **Context Integration**: The bridge context integrates the refined source context with any additional context information, such as environmental data, user input, or other relevant factors.

#### 4.3 Continuity Processing (R2)
---------------------------------

1. **Context Stabilization**: The continuity context (R2) stabilizes the integrated source context, ensuring that it is coherent and consistent.
2. **Context Verification**: The continuity context verifies the stabilized context, checking for any errors or inconsistencies.
3. **Context Output**: The continuity context outputs the final, coherent context, which is used for decision-making and action execution.

### 5. Context Management Procedures
--------------------------------------

#### 5.1 Context Synchronization
---------------------------

1. **Context Update**: The TC skill updates the context in real-time, taking into account any changes to the environment or user input.
2. **Context Consistency**: The TC skill ensures that the context remains consistent and coherent, even in the face of changing circumstances.

#### 5.2 Context Logging
----------------------

1. **Context History**: The TC skill maintains a historical record of the context, enabling analysis and auditing of decision-making and action execution.
2. **Context Debugging**: The TC skill provides debugging tools and facilities to facilitate troubleshooting and optimization of the TC skill.

### 6. Examples
--------------

1. **Scenario 1**: A user interacts with a smart speaker, asking for directions to a nearby restaurant. The TC skill collects context information, validates the user's query, and outputs a response that includes the directions and any relevant menu information.
2. **Scenario 2**: A self-driving car encounters a sudden change in traffic conditions. The TC skill analyzes the changing environment, refines the context, and outputs a revised navigation plan that ensures safe and efficient passage.

### 7. Trigger Conditions
-------------------------

The TC skill is triggered when any of the following conditions are met:

1. **Context Change**: The TC skill detects a significant change in the context, such as a user input, environmental data, or system state.
2. **Context Conflict**: The TC skill detects a conflict between the source context and the continuity context, requiring resolution and re-stabilization of the context.
3. **System Failure**: The TC skill detects a system failure or crash, requiring re-initialization and re-stabilization of the context.

### 8. Output
-------------

The TC skill outputs a final, coherent context (R2) that is used for decision-making and action execution. The output is verified to ensure that it meets the required standards for stability, consistency, and correctness.
