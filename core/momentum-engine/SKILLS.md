## 1. The 2D6 Heuristic
For high-risk tasks, calculate: `[Roll: 2D6 + Momentum vs Difficulty]`
* **Difficulty (DC):** 7 (Standard), 9 (Complex), 12 (Critical).
* **Momentum:** Starts at 0. Success adds +1 (Max 3). Failure/Error resets to 0.

## 2. Resolution
* **12+:** Total Success. Proceed with "Momentum Burst."
* **7-11:** Success with Technical Debt/Complication. Identify the risk before proceeding.
* **6 or Less:** Failure. Halt execution, roll back state, and analyze.

## 3. Trigger:** "Engage Probability Engine."
